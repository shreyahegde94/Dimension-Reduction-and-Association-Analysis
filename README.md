# Dimension-Reduction-and-Association-Analysis
Dimensionality Reduction :  Performed dimensionality reduction on biomedical datasets using the following algorithms: • Principal Component Analysis (PCA) • Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) • T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) Projected high dimensional data to 2 dimensions and compared the results visually.  Association Analysis :  • Implemented Apriori algorithm to identify all frequent itemsets. • Generated association rules based on a given template to correlate gene expressions to diseases .
